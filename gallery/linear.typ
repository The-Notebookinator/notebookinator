#create-frontmatter-entry(title: "Color Coding Guide")[
  This key represents each step of the Engineering Design Process with a color that corresponds to the Engineering Notebooking Rubric categories. In the table of contents, each page is assigned to a color which summarizes the content on that page. However, if a page highlights multiple sections of the Engineering Design Process, headings on the page will be colored accordingly.

  We also wanted to create a new category: Reflect on Prior Solutions. We believe this is an important step in the Engineering Design Process and we want to highlight our reflections using our color coding guide.
